Today I have decided to start Project Euler from the beginning, this time entirely
in Python. I've done some of Project Euler before in a mix of Perl, C, Scala and
Haskell, but it's all been very bitty. Most of the time I would determine that the
language of choice was too slow and just brute force it in C which would, with
some exceptions, be the fastest way to get the job done.

This isn't a very good way to do it.

I've been messing with Python a lot of late and have decided to learn it better. I
would also like to figure out the limits of it when it comes to functional
programming. There is some support for a functional style, especially because
it supports first class and higher order functions, lambdas and excellent list
processing primitives in the form of comprehensions and generators.

And so Euler.py is born. Let's see how I get on.
