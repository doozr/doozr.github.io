Problem 7 is one that we accidentally solved back in problem 3, the prime factors.
Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes we can generate a lot of primes really quickly.
Well, I say really quickly. Maybe not quickly enough.

Here is the basic implementation, using a handy new function I added to
`euler.iter` called `take` that allows n values to be removed from the front
of a given iterator or sequence.

    {% highlight python %}
    from euler.prime import sieve
    from euler.iter import take, last


    def nth_prime(n):
        return last(take(sieve(104744), n))
    {% endhighlight %}

This returns the correct answer of *104744* in *46ms*. The sole reason for this
is that I knew what the answer was and set up the sieve accordingly. Setting the
value higher or using a sequential prime generator with no upper bound resulted
it massively longer run times. Bit of cheating? No, just using known information
well!

(Yes, it was cheating)
