I recently picked up a BBC Micro:bit, ostensibly for the kids, but also
because I really wanted to play with one. I've got a Raspberry PI as has, I
think, everyone else, but never really got on with it. Programming it in situ
was painful because it just wasn't powerful enough and it all just felt a
bit ... underwhelming. It went through a stint as a print server, a NAS,
an AirPlay server and, then, a dust gatherer.

So much potential, so little use. And I didn't know why. It does the stuff but
somehow the barrier to entry was just high enough that my interest never got off
the starting blocks.

## Bring Back The Beeb

What makes the Micro:bit different? Well, it hardly does anything. It has a
5x5 LED display, two buttons, a 3v and 0v connector and 3 I/O ports. At least,
on the surface. Plug a breakout-board into it and that expands to loads of
connectors, some with A/D convertors, some with I<super>2</super>C capability,
and all really easy to use.

This means that a very small amount of code can make something happen, and
getting the code onto it is ludicrously easy. It has its own binary format
called Hex and the compilers from Javascript and Python are free. Just copy
the file to the device via USB mass storage and it Just Worksâ„¢. In fact, most
of the editors can do that bit for you so it's one click and you're done.

If there's one thing I miss about my trusty old BBC Micro, it's the expansion
possibilities. Memory mapped I/O ports, analogue and digital inputs and outputs
that could be written or read as easily as a variable. Essentially a BBC Micro
was an 8-bit microcontroller with its own keyboard and monitor. And the
Micro:bit is its spiritual successor.

It doesn't have a keyboard and screen and speaker and the other bits that make
it a useful desktop computer, but it does have the immediacy that made the Beeb
so easy to work with.

## Blocks Don't Rock

There are a number of ways to code the Micro:bit.  Many of them take their
lead from Scratch, the block based visual programming environment. I had a go
with three:

* Code Kingdoms Javascript
* Microsoft Block Editor
* Microsoft Javascript

![Microsoft Block Editor](/images/bbc_micro_bit_for_fun_not_profit/blocks.png)

The choice of Javascript seems an odd one. I mean, nobody really thinks it's
a *good* language, do they? It's the default language of the web by fluke
and definitely, definitely not by design. And it's the language of Node.js
because, well, it is. And now it's run server side so the same language runs
at both ends of the connection. So yay for the web, I guess.

But I'm definitely not convinced its weirdness is ideal as a beginner language,
and the "block by block" interfaces are clunky. It's very hard to do much of
anything beyond the absolute basics because it just gets too frustratingly slow.

So I started myself and my kids on something that involves a bit more typing and
a bit less farting about with the mouse; Python.

## The Tiniest Python

The Micro:bit is supported by a variant of MicroPython that has a small library
specifically for coding the Micro:bit's various interfaces. It supports driving
the 5x5 display as a tiny set of pixels, of handling the buttons and all the
analogue and digital wizardry you might want, and even the I<super>2</super>C
stuff and what-have-you in the more advanced end. There's even a rudimentary
music and speed synthesis module if you attach your own speaker.

To demonstrate, here is a basic sine wave that animates across the screen.

    {% highlight python %}
    from microbit import *
    from math import sin, radians

    offset = 0

    while True:
        display.clear()
        for x in range(0, 5):
            y = sin(radians(x * 90 + offset)) * 2.5 + 2.5
            y = min(4, max(0, y))
            display.set_pixel(x, int(y), 9)
        offset = (offset + 10) % 360
        sleep(10)
    {% endhighlight %}

In fact, by attaching a potentiometer with crocodile clips to the 3v and 0v
pads and have a third one going to pad 0 from the centre pin, you can control
the frequency pretty much directly. I picked up an "Inventor's Kit" from [Kitronik](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/) along with a bunch of crocodile leads
and a speaker to make getting going easier. The Micro:bit Go edition also
comes with a battery pack so I'd definitely recommend that one.

    {% highlight python %}
    from microbit import *
    from math import sin, radians

    offset = 0

    while True:
        speed = (pin0.read_analog() // 10) + 1
        display.clear()
        for x in range(0, 5):
            y = sin(radians(x * speed + offset)) * 2.5 + 2.5
            y = min(4, max(0, y))
            display.set_pixel(x, int(y), 9)
        offset = (offset + 10) % 360
        sleep(10)
    {% endhighlight %}

That's it. The pin0 read will be a value between 0 and 1023 so integer division
with 10 will result in a speed between 0 and 100. This will ultimately result
in a flat line or, as as the potentiometer is turned, up to 1.111 full sine
waves on the screen! Of course with only 5 pixels width it's rather ... crude.

But that's it. Thanks to the large, friendly tabs for the ports, a few wires
with crocodile clips and a variable resistor it's been possible to make a
working hardware interface with an A/D convertor and affect the running of the
program.

The editor I used is called Mu. It's very basic but does the job, and has
handy things like a one-click flash button to build, copy and run the code
on the Micro:bit, and even a REPL! (Explaining the term REPL to a 9 year old
was interesting ...)

Just to be flash I did a bit extra and made a program that displays animated
swirling patterns based on intersecting sine and cosine waves. Press the
buttons to randomise each of the two waves.

    {% highlight python %}
    from microbit import *
    import random
    from math import sin, cos, radians

    def get_randoms():
        off = random.randint(0, 360)
        speed = random.randint(-90, 90)
        drift = random.randint(0 - abs(speed), abs(speed))
        return off, speed, drift

    x_off, x_speed, x_drift = get_randoms()
    y_off, y_speed, y_drift = get_randoms()

    while True:
        if button_a.was_pressed():
            x_off, x_speed, x_drift = get_randoms()

        if button_b.was_pressed():
            y_off, y_speed, y_drift = get_randoms()

        for y in range(0, 5):
            for x in range(0, 5):
                s = sin(radians(x * x_speed + x_off))
                c = cos(radians(y * y_speed + y_off))
                v = s * c * 4.5 + 4.5
                v = int(min(9, max(0, v)))
                display.set_pixel(x, y, v)

        x_off = (x_off + x_drift) % 360
        y_off = (y_off + y_drift) % 360
        sleep(10)
    {% endhighlight %}

That's the thing with the Micro:bit. It really is a lot of fun and the
super low barrier to entry makes "just one more thing" so easy to get
carried away with.

Coming up: LEDs and Switches and Sound, Oh my!
